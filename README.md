This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Official Deployment

The website can be viewed at https://messages-never-sent.vercel.app/.

## Getting Started

This project uses [next-firebase-auth](https://github.com/gladly-team/next-firebase-auth) which will need to be properly setup.
Create and register your Firebase app by following Step 1 in the official [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

A .env.example file is provided to setup the Environment Variables needed to use the Firebase SDK. For more info on Next.js environment variables, refer to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
